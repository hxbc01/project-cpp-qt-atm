1. create and initialize pointers in the constructor or in one of the class methods
1. delete and return allocated memory in destructor or in one of the class methods
2. allocate memory for those pointers as the object is used
3. in the destructor, test the pointers for null and deallocate them if they are not null.
4. calling delete on a non Null pointer again crashes your program!
5. Memory leaks are one of the most serious issues and complaints about pointers
6. memory allocated with new is not freed automatically
7. If a pointer variable is pointing to memory on the free store and the pointer goes out of
scope or lost (reassigned), the memory is not automatically returned to the free store -> Memory Leak
8. new outputs an address
9. In addition to creating objects on the free store, you can also create data members within
an object on the free store.
10. this is calles aggregation as opposed to composition
